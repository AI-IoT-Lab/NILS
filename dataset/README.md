### ComStock – Commercial Building Dataset
ComStock models the energy performance of the U.S. commercial building stock, including over 350,000 representative building models spanning more than 14 commercial building types like offices, schools, retail stores, warehouses, and hospitals. It incorporates data from the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) and other sources to reflect real-world building characteristics across various climate zones and geographies.
k. The datasets contain 15-min simulated data (using EnergyPlus models)or a large number of commercial buildings in theUSA. Among these buildings, we randomly selected 1,000 buildings each from the commercial and residential sectors within the state of California. After data cleaning and filtering based on load characteristics, the Comstock dataset comprises data from 1,000 commercial buildings, capturing appliance-level energy usage. The dataset includes time-series load profiles for six major appliance categories:Cooling(760), Fans (900), Heat Rejection (110), Heating (440), Refrigeration (310), Water Systems (720). In bracket it contain the actual number of samples present wrt perticular appliance Each appliance load is sampled at 15 min interval resolution after that we also converted it for 30min and 60min interval.This datasets are recorded from the interval of january 1, 2018, to January 1, 2019.



### Restock – Residential Building Dataset
ResStock models the energy usage of the U.S. residential sector, including millions of simulated homes such as single-family, multifamily, and mobile homes. It leverages data from sources like the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) and the U.S. Census, and applies statistical sampling to represent diverse household characteristics—including building age, floor area, HVAC systems, insulation levels, appliance types, occupancy behavior, and income levels. ResStock provides annual energy consumption, carbon emissions, utility bills, energy burden, and 15-minute time-series data across major end-uses such as heating, cooling, water heating, lighting, and appliances.Restock datasets also contain 15-min simulated data (using EnergyPlus models) for a large number of residential buildings in the USA. Among these buildings, we randomly selected 1,000 buildings each from the residential sectors within the state of California. After data cleaning and filtering based on load characteristics the Restock load dataset contains data from 1,000 residential buildings, with appliance-level energy consumption profiles. It includes 11 distinct appliance categories: Ceiling Fan (660), Clothes Dryer (660), Clothes Washer (680), Cooling (750), Fans (560), Dishwasher (660), Freezer (180), Heating (260), Heating Fans (720), Hot Water (190), Garage Lighting (280).In bracket it contain the actual number of samples present wrt perticular appliance Each appliance Similar to the Comstock dataset, the load profiles are available at three temporal resolutions — 15-minute, 30-minute, and 60-minute intervals. Both datasets are recorded from january 1, 2018, to January 1, 2019.


### CER Dataset-
The CER (Commission for Energy Regulation) dataset contains real-world electricity consumption data collected from Irish households at approximately 30-minute intervals. It represents low-frequency smart meter readings that capture total household energy usage over time. Each household is associated with long, variable-length time series, often spanning thousands of time steps. Instead of detailed usage events, the dataset provides weak labels indicating only the presence or absence of specific appliances (e.g., washing machine, dishwasher, dryer) in each home, making it a challenging yet realistic setting for appliance detection. Due to the low sampling rate and lack of per-appliance monitoring, traditional NILM techniques are less effective, motivating the use of deep learning methods like Transformers. In the TransApp framework, the CER dataset is used alongside the Appliance Detection Framework (ADF) to divide long time series into fixed-length subsequences. These subsequences are then fed into a Transformer model that has been pretrained in a self-supervised manner and fine-tuned for appliance presence classification. The dataset plays a central role in evaluating how well the model can infer appliance ownership from aggregated household consumption. Overall, the CER dataset is valuable for advancing scalable, low-frequency appliance detection techniques using real smart meter data.
The Actual dataset contains the data of 4225 buildings out of which we are using the dataset of 3462 buildings at 30 and 60 min time interval for 7 differnet loads/appliance that is cooling, Dishwasher, PluginHeater, Tumbledryer, Washing Machine, Water Heater and Desktop Computer.


### Prayas Energy Dataset-
The Prayas eMARC (Monitoring and Analysis of Residential Electricity Consumption) dataset is a rich, high-resolution smart metering dataset collected by Prayas (Energy Group) in India. It captures detailed electricity consumption data from 115 residential households across urban, semi-urban, and rural areas of Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, spanning from January 2018 to June 2020. Each household was equipped with two GPRS-enabled smart meters—one at the main supply line and another on a major appliance such as a refrigerator or air conditioner—recording minute-level data on active power, energy consumption, voltage, current, and power factor. This allows for both whole-house and appliance-level monitoring. The dataset also includes 15-minute aggregated versions of the same data, making it suitable for a variety of time-series modeling tasks. Alongside the consumption data, Prayas collected detailed household survey data, which includes appliance ownership, usage patterns, and socioeconomic details, enabling context-aware analysis. The sample was selected to ensure diversity across income levels and appliance types. The eMARC dataset supports research in areas such as load disaggregation, demand response, power quality assessment, energy behavior modeling, and the impact of socio-technical factors on electricity usage in Indian households. It is publicly available for academic and non-commercial research.
we are working on 118 different household data in Three different time interval that is 15min, 30min and 60min for the 7 different types of product that is Inverter, Air-Cooler, Air-Conditioner, Fridge, TV, Washing Machine and Water Heater.
